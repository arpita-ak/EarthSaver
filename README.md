Viruses are attacking the park and the player needs to destory as many as viruses for the safety of people in region and self. viruses travel at different speeds, few rotate and scale. when virus reaches the player, it destroys but the player has 3 lifelines, which he can use to survive. 

Player has to tap to emit weapon. Everytime, the bullet hits the virus, they weaken and die. Different viruses have different level of sheath around them which sometimes require multiple bullets to be destroyed. For a particular duration after it is destroyed the player gets some strength. This way a kind of immunity to viruses is aquired for sometime and enables better fight. 
 
For each virus, player gains score. After all 3 lives are lost, the score is recorded in a high score. 
The player can select to restart the game to try to beat their previous high score.

The steps taken in process of development:
+ player movement using touch in mobile device
+ distinguishing between touch for movement of player and shooting bullet
+ player, bullets, enemies, and their collision 
+ 3 lifelines and automatic try again
+ the game flow: start, play, infinite enemies incoming, player die, use a lifeline, respawn, until all lifelines are over, then restart
+ current score and high score
+ audios, muting and unmuting 
+ different types of enemies: strength/bullets required to die, their generation logic and movement
+ different weapons (3 and 5 bullets per shot) with player after destroying different enemies
+ protective shield for player (while respawing it comes naturally, and is also gained after destoying a particular enemy)

future features:
+ better asthetics: Different avatars for player, bg, all UI, smooth animations
+ better and creative storyline
+ more variety weapons: a bomb that destorys all the enemies at once, auto-emitting bullets, multiple diractioned bullets, an aim for targeted killing 
+ distinct level design
